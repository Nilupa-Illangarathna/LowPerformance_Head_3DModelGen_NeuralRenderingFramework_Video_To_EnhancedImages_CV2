CLI COMMANDS

Set environment in Anaconda
conda activate ngp

Pull images from movie; I've put movie directory "chesterwood" in the instant-ngp directory for simplicity. Change "fps 2" to whatever is needed to give you around 100 images.
cd C:\Users\(your path here)\Github\instant-ngp
cd chesterwood
python ..\scripts\colmap2nerf.py --video_in IMG_9471.MOV --video_fps 2 --run_colmap --overwrite
NOTE! This line is a bit different than shown in the video, as advice on aabb_scale's use has changed. Also, I usually want to delete a few images after extracting them, so I don't do an exhaustive match at this point. In fact, I usually hit break (Control-C) when I see "Feature extraction" starting, as the images have all been extracted at that point.

After you delete any blurry or useless frames, continue below to match cameras.

Camera match given set of images. Do for any set of images. Run from directory containing your "images" directory.
python C:\Users\(your path here)\Github\instant-ngp\scripts\colmap2nerf.py --colmap_matcher exhaustive --run_colmap --aabb_scale 16 --overwrite
For videos or closely related sets of shots, you can take out the "--colmap_matcher exhaustive" from the line above, since your images are in order. This saves a few minutes. You could also leave off "--aabb_scale 16" or put 64, the new default; the docs say it is worth playing with this number, see nerf_dataset_tips.md for how (short version: edit it in transforms.json). In my limited testing, I personally have not seen a difference.

run interactive instant-ngp - run from the main directory "instant-ngp"
cd ..
instant-ngp chesterwood
